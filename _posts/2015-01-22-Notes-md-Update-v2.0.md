title: Notes.md Update v2.0
---

Version 2.0 for Notes.md is now available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jonuy.notesmd)! The two big things that come with this update are Dropbox integration and notebook grouping.

#### Dropbox Integration
One of the most commonly requested features was Dropbox integration. Well, here you go! Go to the app's Settings screen to link your Dropbox account. Now any notes you create in the app will sync to the `Apps/notesmd/` folder in your Dropbox. No more needing to manually share notes to get them off your device!

#### Notebooks
You can now group your notes together into notebooks. Organize notes for different classes into their own respective notebooks. Or categorize your growing list of recipes into the different cuisines you've covered. Whatever kinds of notes you've been taking, you now have at least one tool at your disposal to organize with.

#### UI
One minor change also coming with this version is an update to using Material UI. Honestly, I really just wanted the animating hamburger menu to arrow icon when you pull open a navigation drawer. I could open and close that nav drawer all day. There's more work that can be done here, but it's a start.

#### Your Feedback
I've been surprised by the amount of feedback I've been getting for the app, and that it's all been positive and super contructive. Thank you to all who have downloaded the app and offered your feedback on it. Your responses provide both direction for where I should focus my efforts and motivation for the work. Keep em coming!

In the meantime, try out the [update](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jonuy.notesmd) and let me know what you think!
