title: Level Up! update v1.1
---

Today I published an update to [Level Up!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jonuy.levelup) Version 1.1 comes with three new features and some bug fixes.

#### Custom Level Progression
This one comes as the result of the suggestions a couple reviewers have left for the app. You can now set the amount of XP you think you need at each level. By default, it's set to a pseudo-Fibonacci progression. But for people who want more control, the option to customize is now available.

#### Event Notes
The activity log in version 1.0 simply displayed XP events and when they occurred. It served as a very basic way to get a slightly more detailed view of your attribute progression. In this update, you can now attach a note to every XP event. It makes for a great journal of your progression history and remembering the hows, whats, and whys behind what you've done.

#### Streak Counter
For the users trying to form habits, consistency is key. The streak counter tracks how many consecutive days you've been active on a given attribute.

Thanks to the nearly 500 people who have downloaded Level Up! so far. Hopefully this update provides a touch more help towards reaching your goals.
