Thanks for using Notes.md! Here I attempt to explain that I just wanted to build and use an app to take notes in markdown and not collect any user data for malicious reasons. Away I go copying and pasting things from [docracy](http://www.docracy.com/6016/mobile-privacy-policy).

### What Notes.md Collects

The Application (obviously) stores the notes you create. But that data is yours on your device and I've got no way of actually retrieving it.

Other than that, only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help me improve the Application. It may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile operating system, and information about the way you use the Application. 

### Does Notes.md Track My Location?

No. What? Why? This is an app for taking notes.

Ok, but for real, nothing precise. And even then, it's anonymized. Basically whatever Google Analytics gives by default.

### Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. Though it's highly doubtful I'll ever edit this document again, any new Privacy Policy will be posted here. If reading things like this is your cup o' tea, you are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

### Your Consent

By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by me.

### Contact Me

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have any cool gifs you want to pass along, please contact me via email at games.by.uy@gmail.com.
